# Vaalstreetbets

Path of Exile currency market analyzer using the official GGG API.

**Analyzes historical trade data to identify:**
- Markets with high volatility (wide price spreads)
- Triangular trading path inefficiencies
- Persistent and trending market patterns

**Supports:** PoE1 (Chaos-based) and PoE2 (Exalted-based) economies

*Unofficial side project currently in development. Analyzes historical data, not real-time order books.*

**Note:** THIS WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR MACHINE! Requires your own GGG OAuth credentials and configuration to use, which you probably dont have. I may release a webapplication at a later date if it works at all.
